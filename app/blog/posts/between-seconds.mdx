It’s midnight. I take a slow breath and look back at 2025 — a year that somehow has only eight weeks left before it slips into another. At 24, I keep asking myself the same quiet question: Is time moving faster?

Lately, nostalgia has been slipping into my days like a shadow. It lingers, tugging me away from the present. Every minute feels like it’s already becoming a memory — fading before I can even hold it.

2025 has been a life-changing year, yet it feels less surprising than the ones I lived as a child. Back then, the world was full of firsts — every sound, sight, and feeling felt new. I questioned everything, endlessly curious about the motion of life.

Now, with more experience — the ups, the downs, the lessons tucked between them — I sometimes feel like I’ve lost something along the way. The wonder, maybe. Or the ability to be fully amazed by the ordinary.

Maybe that’s what growing up quietly takes from us — not time itself, but the texture of it. Days no longer stretch endlessly like they used to. They compress, folding into each other until months feel like a single breath. We start living efficiently, not curiously.

But every now and then, something small pulls me back — a song from years ago, the smell of rain, the warmth of a late afternoon. For a brief second, time slows. I remember what it felt like to simply be in a moment, not measure it.

I think that's what I'm trying to relearn now: how to let moments feel long again. How to pay attention. How to create "firsts" even in the familiar. Maybe time isn't really moving faster — maybe I just stopped noticing its rhythm.

So tonight, as I sit here under the quiet hum of midnight, I remind myself: life isn't slipping away; it's still unfolding — softly, patiently, in the spaces I forget to look.
